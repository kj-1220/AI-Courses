       "Manufacturers struggle to integrate data from various sources, including sensors, SCADA systems, and ERP software, to create a unified digital twin that accurately represents their complex industrial processes. This siloed approach results in a fragmented understanding of the system's performance, leading to delayed decision-making, reduced productivity, and increased costs.\n",

       "**Challenges:**\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Data Fragmentation**: Sensors, SCADA systems, and ERP software often use proprietary formats, making it difficult to integrate data from different sources.\n",
       "2. **Operational Silos**: Industrial processes are typically monitored by separate teams using specialized tools, leading to a lack of standardization and consistency in data collection and reporting.\n",
       "3. **Lack of Standardization**: There is no universally accepted framework for defining digital twins, making it hard to identify and integrate relevant data sources.\n",

       "3. **Control and Governance:** Establishing control mechanisms and governance structures to ensure the safety, reliability, and fairness of the Agentic AI system.\n",
